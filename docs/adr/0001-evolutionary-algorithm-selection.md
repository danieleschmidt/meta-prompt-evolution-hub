# ADR-0001: Evolutionary Algorithm Selection

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The Meta-Prompt-Evolution-Hub requires sophisticated evolutionary algorithms to optimize prompts across multiple objectives. We need to select appropriate algorithms that can handle:
- Multi-objective optimization (accuracy, cost, latency, safety)
- Large population sizes (100K+ prompts)
- Diversity maintenance in prompt space
- Continuous adaptation and learning

## Decision
We will implement a hybrid evolutionary approach using multiple algorithms:

1. **NSGA-II** as the primary multi-objective optimizer
2. **MAP-Elites** for diversity maintenance and exploration
3. **CMA-ES** for fine-tuning in continuous parameter spaces
4. **Novelty Search** for discovering unconventional prompt strategies

## Consequences

### Positive
- Multi-objective optimization ensures balanced prompt performance
- MAP-Elites maintains population diversity preventing premature convergence
- CMA-ES provides efficient local optimization capabilities
- Modular design allows algorithm switching based on task requirements
- Well-established algorithms with proven track records

### Negative
- Increased implementation complexity requiring multiple algorithm frameworks
- Higher computational overhead from running multiple optimization strategies
- Complex parameter tuning across different algorithms
- Potential algorithm interaction effects requiring careful coordination

### Neutral
- Requires comprehensive testing across different prompt domains
- Documentation overhead for multiple algorithm configurations
- Team needs expertise in evolutionary computation principles

## Alternatives Considered

### Option 1: Single Algorithm Approach (NSGA-II Only)
- **Pros**: Simpler implementation, well-understood behavior, proven multi-objective capabilities
- **Cons**: Limited exploration, potential premature convergence, no specialization for different optimization phases
- **Decision**: Rejected due to lack of diversity maintenance and exploration capabilities

### Option 2: Custom Genetic Algorithm
- **Pros**: Tailored specifically for prompt optimization, full control over implementation
- **Cons**: Requires extensive research and development, unproven performance, higher maintenance burden
- **Decision**: Rejected due to time constraints and availability of proven algorithms

### Option 3: Reinforcement Learning Approach
- **Pros**: Adaptive learning, potential for discovering novel strategies
- **Cons**: Requires extensive training data, complex reward engineering, less interpretable results
- **Decision**: Considered for future research but rejected for initial implementation

## Implementation Notes

### Algorithm Coordination Strategy
- Use NSGA-II for primary population evolution
- Run MAP-Elites in parallel to maintain archive of diverse solutions
- Apply CMA-ES for local refinement of promising regions
- Integrate Novelty Search during exploration phases

### Parameter Configuration
```python
algorithms = {
    "nsga2": {
        "population_size": 1000,
        "crossover_rate": 0.7,
        "mutation_rate": 0.1
    },
    "map_elites": {
        "grid_size": [20, 20, 20],
        "behavior_dimensions": ["formality", "specificity", "length"]
    },
    "cma_es": {
        "sigma": 0.1,
        "population_size": 50
    }
}
```

### Migration Strategy
1. Implement NSGA-II as baseline
2. Add MAP-Elites for diversity
3. Integrate CMA-ES for refinement
4. Add Novelty Search for exploration
5. Develop algorithm coordination layer
