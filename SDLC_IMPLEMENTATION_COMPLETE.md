- `cd.yml` - Continuous Deployment  
- `security-scan.yml` - Security Scanning

### 2. Repository Configuration
- Configure branch protection rules for `main` branch
- Set up required status checks
- Configure repository secrets for deployments
- Enable security features (dependency scanning, secret scanning)

### 3. Infrastructure Prerequisites
- Set up cloud infrastructure (EKS clusters, databases, etc.)
- Configure monitoring and alerting systems
- Set up backup and disaster recovery procedures
