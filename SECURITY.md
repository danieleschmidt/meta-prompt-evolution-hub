## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Meta-Prompt-Evolution-Hub seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. Send an email to **daniel@example.com** with the subject line "Security Vulnerability Report"
3. Include the following information:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### What to Expect

- **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment within 5 business days
- **Resolution Timeline**: Critical vulnerabilities will be addressed within 30 days
- **Credit**: We will credit you in our security advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## Security Best Practices

When using Meta-Prompt-Evolution-Hub, please follow these security guidelines:

### Data Protection
- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, credentials) to version control
- Use environment variables for configuration secrets
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest and in transit
- Regularly rotate API keys and credentials

### Prompt Security
- Sanitize user inputs in prompt templates
- Validate and escape dynamic content in prompts
- Be cautious with prompts that execute code or system commands
- Monitor for prompt injection attempts

### Network Security
- Use HTTPS for all API communications
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Rate limit API endpoints to prevent abuse
- Use VPNs or private networks for sensitive deployments

### Infrastructure Security
- Keep dependencies up to date
- Regularly scan for vulnerabilities using tools like `safety` and `bandit`
- Use container scanning for Docker deployments
- Implement proper logging and monitoring

### AI/ML Security
- Validate model outputs before use in production
- Implement content filtering for generated text
- Monitor for adversarial inputs and outputs
- Regularly audit model behavior and performance

## Known Security Considerations

### Prompt Injection
- The nature of prompt evolution may create vectors for prompt injection
- Always validate and sanitize inputs from external sources
- Consider using input filtering and output validation

### Data Privacy
- Prompt evolution may retain sensitive information from training data
- Implement data retention policies and regular data purging
- Consider privacy-preserving techniques for sensitive datasets

### Resource Exhaustion
- Large-scale evolution can consume significant computational resources
- Implement resource limits and monitoring
- Use timeouts and circuit breakers for external API calls

## Security Testing

We employ the following security testing practices:

- **Static Analysis**: Code scanning with Bandit and Ruff
- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular checks with Safety
- **Secret Detection**: Pre-commit hooks with detect-secrets
- **Dynamic Testing**: Security testing as part of CI/CD pipeline

## Security Features

### Built-in Security Controls
- Input validation and sanitization
- Rate limiting for API endpoints
- Secure configuration management
- Audit logging for security events

### Security Monitoring
- Failed authentication attempts
- Unusual API usage patterns
- Resource consumption anomalies
- Model output quality degradation

## Compliance

Meta-Prompt-Evolution-Hub is designed to support compliance with:

- **GDPR**: Data protection and privacy rights
- **CCPA**: California Consumer Privacy Act
- **SOC 2**: Security and availability standards
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management

## Third-Party Security

We regularly monitor and update our dependencies for security vulnerabilities:

- Ray (distributed computing)
- Sentence Transformers (ML models)
- FastAPI/Typer (web framework)
- Database connectors (PostgreSQL, Redis)

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **Security Email**: daniel@example.com
- **PGP Key**: Available upon request
- **Response Time**: 48 hours for acknowledgment

## Changelog

Security-related changes are documented in our [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) with the `[SECURITY]` prefix.
